## Directory structure
---
This project uses a modular structure so that key areas remain seperated, allowing them to be worked on seperately to create a clear and focused workflow.

### src
The src folder contains all of my source code (duh). It is broken up into other folders to keep the different aspects of my source code seperate like ow my models folder contains all of my model classes that deal with the real world items of my gym such as users and merchandise while my ui folder contains my menu's. 

### resources
The resources folder is meant to contain files used by the program, in this case my txt file that it will write to. 

### sql
This folder contains the schema that will populate my database.

### docs
This folder contains all of my documentation, it currently contains the development guide and the user guide but will contain my graphs and diagrams in the future.
